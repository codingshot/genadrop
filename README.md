# ALGORAND UPDATE 1

### January 3rd, 2021

Thank you so much Algorand Foundation and Happy New Year! Let this year be the year of getting Algorand dApps into production.

We have made a lot of progress with Genadrop. Right now genadrop is used by artists to generate art. We have even been spending time adding functionality as we launch NFT drops to help the creative process.

Check out the product today at genadrop.com and here is a very quick demo https://youtu.be/DnjhyvK4dUY

Milestone 2 YouTube Deliverable

Our second deliverable is completed however we already have a mitner working, So essentially half of milestone 3 and all milestone 3.

Return IPFS json
Preview collection, number of pictures, layers and size

Thank you so much for your continued support. Would love to pilot some drops as other foundations are asking us to add minters and definitely want Algorand support in the marketing of the genadrop marketplace when it comes out.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
